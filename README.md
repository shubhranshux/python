# Snake, Water, Gun Game

Welcome to the Snake, Water, Gun game! This is a simple text-based game implemented in Python where you play against the computer. 

## Game Description

The game is a variation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors. In this version, the choices are:

- **Snake (s)**: represented by `1`
- **Water (w)**: represented by `-1`
- **Gun (g)**: represented by `0`

The game follows these rules:

- Snake defeats Water.
- Water defeats Gun.
- Gun defeats Snake.

When you make your choice, the computer randomly selects one of the three options. The game then determines the winner based on the rules above.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Execute the Python script to start the game.
2. **Make a Choice**: When prompted, enter your choice:
   - `s` for Snake
   - `w` for Water
   - `g` for Gun
3. **View Results**: The game will display what both you and the computer chose, and then it will announce the result (win, lose, or draw).

## Example

Here's what a sample game interaction might look like:

```
Enter your choice: s
You chose: s
Computer chose: g
You lose!
```

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Save the provided Python script to a file named `snake_water_gun.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python snake_water_gun.py
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

## Code

Here is the Python code for the game:

```python
import random

'''
1 for snake
-1 for water 
0 for gun 
'''

computer = random.choice([-1, 0, 1])
youstr = input("Enter your choice (s for Snake, w for Water, g for Gun): ")
youDict = {"s": 1, "w": -1, "g": 0}
reverseDict = {1: "s", -1: "w", 0: "g"}

you = youDict[youstr]

print(f"You chose: {reverseDict[you]}\nComputer chose: {reverseDict[computer]}")
if computer == you:
    print("It's a draw")
else:
    if computer == -1 and you == 1:
        print("You win!")
    elif computer == -1 and you == 0:
        print("You lose!")
    elif computer == 1 and you == -1:
        print("You lose!")
    elif computer == 0 and you == -1:
        print("You win!")
    elif computer == 1 and you == 0:
        print("You win!")
    elif computer == 0 and you == 1:
        print("You lose!")
    else:
        print("Something went wrong!")
```
